# Unnamed Movement Shooter Game

This project is the culmination of a handfull of attempts at creating a specific movement shooter they I've had in mind for about 4 years now.

Current Master Design doccument: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T4s6P-lCuvQuTB0PGpyCWa0lEcJ8GLOxz9FmPV_TSdg/edit?usp=sharing 

Currently the gameplay is being prototyped (proof-of-concept) in Unity but once I work out how I want the game to feel then I will move to either GoDot (probably) or write the game entirely in C from thhe ground up (unlikley, but possible for a future game-engine dev centric project).
